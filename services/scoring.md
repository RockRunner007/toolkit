# Scoring Weakness by Risk

This document outlines a methodology for scoring application security weaknesses by risk, leveraging the [OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/) and principles from [Business Impact Analysis (BIA)](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/understanding-risk-through-bia-assessment-processes-brian-gray-rus1c/).

## Overview

Risk scoring helps prioritize remediation efforts by evaluating the potential impact and likelihood of security weaknesses. This approach combines technical security controls (OWASP ASVS) with business context (BIA) to provide a comprehensive risk assessment.

## Methodology

### 1. Identify Weaknesses

- Use OWASP ASVS to systematically identify security weaknesses in the application.
- Map findings to specific ASVS requirements.

### 2. Assess Likelihood

- Evaluate how likely each weakness is to be exploited, considering:
    - Ease of exploitation
    - Exposure to attackers
    - Existing controls

### 3. Assess Impact

- Use BIA principles to determine the business impact if the weakness is exploited:
    - Data confidentiality, integrity, and availability
    - Regulatory and reputational consequences
    - Financial loss

### 4. Calculate Risk Score

- Assign numerical values to likelihood and impact (e.g., 1–5 scale).
- Calculate risk:  
    `Risk Score = Likelihood × Impact`
- Categorize risk (e.g., Low, Medium, High, Critical).

### 5. Prioritize Remediation

- Address weaknesses with the highest risk scores first.
- Document rationale and mitigation steps.

## Example

| Weakness                | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Score | Priority |
|-------------------------|------------|--------|------------|----------|
| Insecure Authentication | 4          | 5      | 20         | High     |
| Verbose Error Messages  | 2          | 2      | 4          | Low      |
