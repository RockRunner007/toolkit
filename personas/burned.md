# The Burned

This persona is characterized by their strong resistance to adopting new technologies or tools due to a negative past experience. Their skepticism isn't based on ignorance, but on firsthand (often flawed) encounters that left them with a strong conviction that the technology is inefficient or problematic. This makes their opinion highly credible to others and challenging to counter. To influence them, you must understand the specifics of their past failure, determine if the proposed solution is genuinely appropriate for the current context, and then carefully communicate how the current implementation or situation differs, without appearing to blame them for their past struggles. Their conversion is difficult but possible with significant effort and a tailored approach.
