# The Uninformed

This individual is unaware of common technological solutions and best practices, not out of malice, but due to a lack of exposure or understanding of the problems these solutions address. They don't actively seek out new information and may disregard company-wide announcements. They become acutely aware of their knowledge gaps only when a crisis hits, often expecting others to magically fix their self-inflicted issues. While easy to inform, they are more likely to become skeptical than immediately adopt new practices.
