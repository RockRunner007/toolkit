# The Time Crunched

This persona is characterized by their consistent objection to new initiatives, claiming a perpetual lack of time. They are often caught in a cycle of short-sighted problem-solving, prioritizing immediate tasks over long-term solutions that could save time. Their "time crunch" can stem from poor planning, understaffing, cyclical work demands, or even the inherent nature of their project. To gain their buy-in, you must demonstrate how your proposed solution will directly save them time and offer a clear path to relief from their overloaded schedules.
